# Virtual Pet

## Application that lets you play with a cute model.pet!

I played *Neopets* and *Pet Society* when I was young, and I wanted to recreate a virtual model.pet game for this project.

What this application can do:
- **Login using your own username** (not implemented yet)
- Create a cat, and **associate with the user account** (not implemented yet)
- Buy consumables from model.shop 
- Feed, play, chat with your cat using consumables!


##User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create my cat

- As a user, I want to be able to buy consumables from shop

- As a user, I want to be able to interact with my cat using consumables

- As a user, I want to be able to view my cat's status(happiness, hunger level, energy level)
