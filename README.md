# Virtual Cat

## Application that lets you interact with a cat!

I played *Neopets* and *Pet Society* when I was young, and I wanted to recreate a virtual model.pet game for this project.

What this application can do:
- Login using your own username (**changed to auto save and auto load**)
- Create a cat, and associate with the user account 
- Buy consumables from shop
- Feed, play, with your cat using consumables!


##User Stories P1
- As a user, I want to be able to create my cat and add it to user 

- As a user, I want to be able to buy food from shop (adding multiple X to Y)

- As a user, I want to be able to feed my cat using food bought from shop

- As a user, I want to be able to check my Inventory

- As a user, I want to be able to view my cat's status(happiness, hunger level, energy level)

##User Stories P2
- As a user, I want to be able to save my user data to file 
    (saved automatically when quitting game)

- As a user, I want to be able to load my user data from file
    (loaded automatically when start up game)
    
- As a user, I want to see more realism by adding time and stat decay in Cat...

##User Stories P3
- Can Feed, Purchase Food, and View Food in Gui

- When auto save, or load, pop up message will indicate saving from "./data/user.json" or not found
    status change and persistance cant be found in status panel
    
- When cat happiness reaches >= 70 or >= 90, new cat icons will appear and replacce old
