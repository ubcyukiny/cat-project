# Virtual Pet

## Application that lets you play with a cute pet!

I played *Neopets* and *Pet Society* when I was young, and I wanted to recreate a virtual pet game for this project.

What this application can do:
- Login using your own username
- Choose one of Dog or Cat, and associate with the user account
- Customize Pet's name
- Feed, play, chat with your pet!
