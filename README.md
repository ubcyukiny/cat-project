# Virtual Cat

## Application that lets you interact with a cat!

I played *Neopets* and *Pet Society* when I was young, and I wanted to recreate a virtual model.pet game for this project.

What this application can do:
- Login using your own username (**not implemented yet**)
- Create a cat, and associate with the user account (**not implemented yet**)
- Buy consumables from shop
- Feed, play, chat with your cat using consumables! (**not fully implemented yet**)
